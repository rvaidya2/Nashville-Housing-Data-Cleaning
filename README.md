# Nashville Housing Data Cleaning Project README
## This project involves cleaning and standardizing the Nashville Housing dataset using SQL queries. Here's a summary of the key cleaning steps:

1. Standardizing Date Format: Converted SaleDate to a standard format.
2. Populating Property Address Data: Filled missing Property Address values.
3. Breaking out Address: Split Property Address into separate columns for Address, City, and State.
4. Parsing Owner Address: Extracted Street, City, and State details from Owner Address.
5. Changing Yes/No: Converted 'Y' and 'N' to 'Yes' and 'No' respectively in the "Sold as Vacant" field.
6. Removing Duplicates: Eliminated duplicate entries based on specific criteria.
7. Deleting Unused Columns: Removed unnecessary columns like Owner Address and Tax District.
